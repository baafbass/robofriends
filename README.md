  ## Redux Integration
  ### State Management
  The core feature of the Robofriends project is its utilization of Redux for state management.
  The entire application state, including robot data and user interactions, is centralized within a Redux store.
  This ensures a single source of truth for the application's data.

  ### Actions
  In Robofriends, user interactions trigger actions that describe the changes to the application state.
  These actions are dispatched to the Redux store, initiating the appropriate updates.
  Actions are defined as plain JavaScript objects, providing a clear and predictable way to communicate state changes.
